## How to Test PWA Installation

### On Chrome (Desktop)
1. Visit your site: `https://qrch.online`
2. Look for the install icon in the address bar (⊕ or computer icon)
3. Click it and select "Install"
4. The app will open in a standalone window

### On Chrome/Edge (Android)
1. Visit your site on mobile browser
2. Tap the menu (⋮)
3. Select "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"
4. The app icon will appear on your home screen

### On Safari (iOS)
**Note:** Safari doesn't support full PWA installation, but you can add to home screen:
1. Tap the Share button (□↑)
2. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
3. Confirm and the icon will appear on your home screen

## Verify Installation

### Check in Chrome DevTools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Check **Manifest** section:
   - Should show "QRMH - Event Badge Management System"
   - Display: standalone
   - Theme color: #10b981
   - All 4 icons should be listed

4. Check **Service Workers** section:
   - Should show service worker registered at `/build/sw.js`
   - Status: activated and running
   - Scope: `/`

### Test Offline Capability
1. Install the PWA
2. Open Chrome DevTools > Network tab
3. Enable "Offline" mode
4. Navigate to different pages
5. The app should still work (cached assets)

## App Shortcuts

When you install the PWA, you'll get two quick shortcuts:
1. **Scan QR** - Direct access to `/check-in` for quick attendee scanning
2. **Dashboard** - Direct access to `/dashboard`

Right-click the installed app icon to access these shortcuts.

## Technical Details

### Files Generated
- `/public/pwa-*.png` - PWA icons
- `/public/build/sw.js` - Service worker (6KB)
- `/public/build/workbox-*.js` - Workbox library (22KB)
- `/public/build/manifest.webmanifest` - PWA manifest (962B)
- `/public/build/registerSW.js` - Service worker registration script

### Configuration Location
- Main config: `vite.config.js`
- PWA plugin: vite-plugin-pwa v1.1.0

### Cache Strategy
- **Static Assets**: Precached (95 entries, ~3MB)
- **API Calls**: NetworkFirst with 7-day cache
- **Images/Fonts**: Included in precache

## Troubleshooting

### Install Button Not Showing?
1. **Check HTTPS**: PWA requires HTTPS (you're using it ✓)
2. **Check Manifest**: Visit `/build/manifest.webmanifest` - should load
3. **Check Icons**: Visit `/pwa-192x192.png` - should show icon
4. **Check Service Worker**: DevTools > Application > Service Workers
5. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes old caches prevent new PWA registration
   - DevTools > Application > Storage > Clear site data
   - Reload the page

### Service Worker Not Registering?
1. Check Console for errors (F12 > Console)
2. Make sure `/build/sw.js` is accessible
3. Check that scope is `/` in DevTools > Application > Service Workers

### Icons Not Loading?
1. Check file permissions: `ls -la /home/qrch.online/public_html/public/pwa-*.png`
2. Should be readable by web server (755 or 644)
3. If needed: `chmod 644 /home/qrch.online/public_html/public/pwa-*.png`

## Browser Support

- Opera 60+

## Next Steps

3. **Test on mobile** devices for the best experience
4. **Share feedback** on the PWA functionality
