### ✅ Email Phase 2: Campaign System (Backend 100%, Frontend 30%)
**Status: BACKEND READY, FRONTEND PARTIAL**

#### What's Complete (Backend):

1. **Database Structure**
   - `email_campaigns` table - stores campaign details
   - `email_campaign_recipients` table - tracks individual sends
   - Status tracking: draft → sending → sent/failed

2. **Models & Relationships**
   - `EmailCampaign` model with helper methods
   - `CampaignRecipient` model for tracking
   - Full Eloquent relationships

3. **Email System**
   - `CampaignEmail` mailable
   - Professional HTML template
   - Attachment support (multiple files, 10MB each)
   - Queue jobs for bulk sending

4. **Controller & Routes**
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Recipient filtering:
     - By event
     - By category (exhibitor, visitor, etc.)
     - By registration date range
   - Preview recipient count
   - Bulk send with queue
   - Statistics tracking

5. **Frontend (Partial)**
   - Campaign list page (`/campaigns`)
   - Status badges, statistics, actions
   - Pagination

#### What's Needed (Frontend Only):

Three Vue.js pages (estimated 2-3 hours):
1. **Create.vue** - Campaign composer with filters
2. **Show.vue** - Campaign details and statistics
3. **Edit.vue** - Edit draft campaigns

**All backend logic is ready and tested!** Just needs UI.

## 📝 Next Steps (For Next Session)

### Priority 1: Complete Campaign Frontend
Create these 3 Vue.js pages:

1. **`resources/js/Pages/Campaigns/Create.vue`**
   - Form with name, subject, body
   - Filters (event, categories, dates)
   - Attachment upload
   - Preview recipients button
   - Estimated time: 1 hour

2. **`resources/js/Pages/Campaigns/Show.vue`**
   - Campaign details card
   - Statistics (sent, failed, pending)
   - Recipients table with status
   - Send/Edit/Delete actions
   - Estimated time: 1.5 hours

3. **`resources/js/Pages/Campaigns/Edit.vue`**
   - Same as Create, pre-populated
   - Only for draft campaigns
   - Estimated time: 30 minutes

**I've created a detailed guide:** `EMAIL_PHASE_2_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md` with:
- Exact code templates
- Implementation steps
- Testing instructions
- How the system works

### Priority 2: Enhanced Features (Optional)

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Email Flow:

```
User Action → Controller → Job Queue → Background Worker → Email Sent
```

**Example: Welcome Email**
1. User creates attendee → `AttendeeController::store()`
2. Job queued → `SendWelcomeEmail::dispatch()`
3. Queue worker picks up job
4. Email sent → `WelcomeEmail` mailable
5. Status logged

**Example: Campaign Email**
1. User clicks "Send" → `CampaignController::send()`
2. Job queued → `ProcessCampaign::dispatch()`
3. Campaign status → "sending"
4. Individual jobs queued → `SendCampaignEmail::dispatch()` (x recipients)
5. Each email sent individually
6. Status tracked in `campaign_recipients` table
7. Campaign status → "sent"
