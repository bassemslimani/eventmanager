## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Can't see Events menu as Admin?
```bash
# Clear browser cache and reload
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Getting 403 errors?
**This is expected!** The middleware is working correctly:
- Agents cannot access admin pages
- Event managers cannot access Events menu
- Users cannot access events they're not assigned to

### Login not working?
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan db:seed --class=TestUsersSeeder
```
