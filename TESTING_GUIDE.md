## üêõ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: 403 Forbidden Errors
**Solution:** This is expected! It means the role-based middleware is working correctly.
- Agents cannot access admin/manager pages
- Event managers cannot access admin pages
- Users cannot access events they're not assigned to

### Issue: Login doesn't work
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear cache
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Re-run seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=TestUsersSeeder
```

### Issue: Navigation menu not showing correct links
**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild frontend
npm run build

# Or restart Vite
# Ctrl+C in Terminal 2, then:
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Events/Attendees not showing
**Solution:**
- Verify you're logged in as correct role
- Admin: sees all data
- Event Manager: sees only assigned events
- Agent: sees only scanner dashboard

---

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

After all tests, you should have:

| Role | Events Access | Attendees Access | User Management | Scanner |
|------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Admin | All events (can create/edit) | All attendees | All users (can create any role) | Yes |
| Event Manager | Assigned events only (read-only) | Only from assigned events | Only for assigned events | Yes |
| Agent | Assigned events (read-only list) | No access | No access | Yes (primary function) |

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
