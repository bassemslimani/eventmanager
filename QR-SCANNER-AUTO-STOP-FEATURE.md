# ✅ QR Scanner Auto-Stop Feature

## What Was Changed

The QR scanner camera now **automatically stops after 10 seconds** instead of recording continuously.

## New Features

### 1. **10-Second Auto-Stop Timer**
- Camera starts when you click "Start Scanning"
- Automatically stops after exactly 10 seconds
- Prevents continuous recording/battery drain
- Frees up camera resources

### 2. **Visual Countdown Timer**
Located in the top-right corner of the scanner view:
- Shows remaining time (e.g., "10s", "9s", "8s"...)
- Clock icon for easy recognition
- Progress bar showing time remaining
- Updates every second

### 3. **Clear Visual Feedback**
When camera is stopped, you'll see:
- Blurred overlay on the video
- Camera icon
- "Camera Stopped" message
- Instruction to click "Start Scanning" to reactivate

### 4. **Smart Timer Management**
The timer automatically clears when:
- ✅ QR code is successfully scanned (stops immediately)
- ✅ User manually clicks "Stop Scanning" button
- ✅ User leaves the page
- ✅ 10 seconds elapse (auto-stop)

## How It Works

### Starting a Scan
1. Click **"Start Scanning"** button
2. Camera activates
3. Countdown starts from 10 seconds
4. Scanner looks for QR codes

### During Scanning (10 seconds)
- Top-right shows countdown: "10s" → "9s" → "8s" → ...
- Blue scanning frame appears over video
- Progress bar shrinks as time decreases

### When Timer Reaches 0
- Camera automatically stops
- Video overlay appears: "Camera Stopped"
- Button changes to "Start Scanning"
- Click button to start a new 10-second scan

### If QR Code is Scanned (Before 10 seconds)
- Camera stops immediately
- Timer is cleared
- Result is displayed
- Click "Continue Scanning" to start a new 10-second scan

## Benefits

✅ **Battery Saving**: Camera doesn't run indefinitely
✅ **Privacy**: Camera turns off automatically
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Users always know how much time is left
✅ **Resource Management**: Frees up camera for other apps
✅ **Better UX**: No need to remember to stop the camera

## Technical Details

- **Timeout Duration**: 10 seconds (configurable)
- **Countdown Interval**: Updates every 1 second
- **Auto-cleanup**: All timers cleared on page exit
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

## Customization (Optional)

If you want to change the timeout duration, edit this line in:
`/resources/js/Pages/CheckIn/Scanner.vue`

```typescript
const SCAN_TIMEOUT = 10; // Change this number (in seconds)
```

For example:
- `const SCAN_TIMEOUT = 5;` → 5-second timeout
- `const SCAN_TIMEOUT = 15;` → 15-second timeout
- `const SCAN_TIMEOUT = 30;` → 30-second timeout

After changing, run: `npm run build`

## Testing the Feature

2. Click "Start Scanning"
3. Watch the countdown in top-right corner
4. Wait 10 seconds (or scan a QR code)
5. Camera should stop automatically
