## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Queue Configuration
- Queue driver is set to `database` in `.env`
- Run queue worker: `php artisan queue:work`
- For production, use supervisor or systemd to keep worker running
- Jobs are queued for async processing to prevent request timeouts

### Mail Configuration
- Mail settings are loaded dynamically from database via `DynamicConfigServiceProvider`
- Settings are cached for 1 hour to improve performance
- Cache is cleared when settings are updated

### File Storage
- Badges are stored in `storage/app/public/badges/`
- Logos are stored in `storage/app/public/branding/`
- SEO images are stored in `storage/app/public/seo/`
- Run `php artisan storage:link` to create symbolic link

### Email Templates
- Located in `resources/views/emails/`
- Use Blade templating with access to attendee and event data
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
- Support for RTL languages (Arabic)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Badge PDF Generation**: Currently done client-side (frontend). For email sending, PDF must be uploaded. Future enhancement could implement server-side PDF generation.

2. **Email Phase 2 Not Yet Implemented**: Campaign management system is planned but not yet built.

3. **No Unsubscribe Feature**: Future enhancement for campaign emails.

4. **No Email Analytics**: Open rates and click tracking not yet implemented.
